updated NOTE: I take your advice of createing a beforeAll and afterAll to migrate the database instead of just add the test script even though before all tests was successed for me, anyway I upated my tests folder and create a function to migrate the database with data I need to all tests requirments, here is a screenshut of the successfull tests

![Test Cases](/assets/images/screen.png)

NOTE:I add the missing try/catch the all my functions - I double check the test script but it seems that everything works fine for me, so I think this erros that appears on your machine because u use different OS, I use windown 10, so if you use macOS, try replace the test script in package.json file with this script

NOTE:to make sure that you are running the script on TESTING mood, this message `-------------------TEST------------------` NOT this `-------------------DEV-------------------` should appear before implementing any jasmine test case

```
"test": "db-migrate up:test --env test && ENV=test && npm run build && npm run jasmine && db-migrate down:test --env test -c 4",
```

# .env File

create `.env` file in the root directory and set your password in `###`

```
ENV = dev

POSTGRES_DRIVER = pg
POSTGRES_HOST=127.0.0.1
POSTGRES_DB = store
POSTGRES_DB_TEST = store_test
POSTGRES_USERNAME = postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD = ###

JWT_PASS = knock_knock_who_is_there
BCRYPT_PASSWORD = not_your_bug_fix
RETURN_TOKEN = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InRlc3QiLCJpYXQiOjE2NTM0MjgwNzV9.CMpEGAa-zeFAOp5bNq7QlXyI3o4M75M9Hhp9vDrynxk
SALT_ROUNDS = 10
```
